	 * A class that is declared with abstract keyword, is known as abstract class in java.
	 * It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with body)
	 * Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
	 * Another way, it shows only important things to the user and hides the internal details.
	 * There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
	 * 1.Abstract class (0 to 100%)
	 * 2.Interface (100%)
	 * A class that is declared as abstract is known as abstract class.It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.
	 * A method that is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as abstract method.
	 * Rule: If there is any abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.
