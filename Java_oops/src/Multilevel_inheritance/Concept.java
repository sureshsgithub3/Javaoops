	 * in Multilevel inheritance there is a concept of grand parent class.
	 * If we take the example of above diagram then class C inherits class B and class B inherits class A .
	 *  So in this case class C is implicitly inheriting the properties and method of class A along with B that’s what is called multilevel inheritance.
