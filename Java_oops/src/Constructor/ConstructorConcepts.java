	 * Constructor is a block of code that allows you to create an object of class.
	 * Java constructor is invoked at the time of object creation. 
	 * It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object that is why it is known as constructor.
	 * There are basically two rules defined for the constructor.
	 * 1.Constructor name must be same as its class name
	 * 2.Constructor must have no explicit return type.
	 * There are three types of constructors: 
	 * 1. default, 
	 * 2. no-arg and
	 * 3.parameterised.
	 * If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.
	 * this is called default constructor
