public class ConstructorConcepts {
	/*Every class has a constructor whether it’s normal one or a abstract class.
	 * constructor are not methods and they don’t have any return type.
	 * Constructor name and class name should be the same.
	 * Constructor can use any access specifier, they can be declared as private also.  
	 * Private constructors are possible in java but there scope is within the class only.
	 * Like constructors method can also have name same as class name, but still they have return type, 
	 * though which we can identify them that they are methods not constructors.
	 * Constructor is a block of code that allows you to create an object of class.
	 * Java constructor is invoked at the time of object creation. 
	 * It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object that is why it is known as constructor.
	 * There are basically two rules defined for the constructor.
	 * 1.Constructor name must be same as its class name
	 * 2.Constructor must have no explicit return type.
	 * There are three types of constructors: 
	 * 1. default, 
	 * 2. no-arg and
	 * 3.parameterised.
	 * If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.
	 * this is called default constructor
	 * constructor cannot be override .
	 * when we are extending a class with contructor with parameterised then it should be in involed in child class.
