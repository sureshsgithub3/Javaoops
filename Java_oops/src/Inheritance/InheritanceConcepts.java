package Inheritance;

/**
 *  Inheritance allows a class to use the properties and methods of another class.
 *  The derived class is also called subclass and the base class is also known as super-class. 
 *  These additional variable and methods differentiates the derived class from the base class.
 *  Inheritance is a compile-time mechanism. 
 *  A super-class can have any number of subclasses. But a subclass can have only one superclass. 
 *  Java does not support multiple inheritance.
 *  The superclass and subclass have “is-a” relationship between them. 
 *  Constructors and Inheritance
 *  The constructor in the superclass is responsible for building the object of the superclass and the constructor of the subclass builds the object of subclass
 *  When the subclass constructor is called during object creation.
 *   it by default invokes the default constructor of super-class. 
 *   Hence, in inheritance the objects are constructed top-down.
