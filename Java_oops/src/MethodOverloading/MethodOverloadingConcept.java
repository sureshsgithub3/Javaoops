 * @author suresh
 * Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have two or more methods having same name.
 * Points to Note: Static Polymorphism is also known as compile time binding or early binding.
 *  Method return type doesn’t matter in case of overloading.
 *  If you overload static method in java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism.
