package Polymorphism;

/**Polymorphism in java is a concept by which we can perform a single action by different ways.
 * There are two types of polymorphism in java: compile time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.
 * We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
 * If you overload static method in java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism.
 * Runtime polymorphism:is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.
 *  In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass
 * Rule: Runtime polymorphism can't be achieved by data members.
 * Overriding method must not have more restrictive access modifier
 * Abstract methods must be overridden.
 * Static and final methods cannot be overridden.
 * Constructors cannot be overridden
